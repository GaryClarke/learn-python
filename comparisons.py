# STUDENT CHALLENGE
# create an input which asks for age
age = int(input('Please enter your age: '))
age_limit = 18
# use conditional to check age against an age limit
# set old_enough to True IF age >= age_limit
old_enough = True
if age < age_limit:
    old_enough = False

# print(old_enough)
print(old_enough)

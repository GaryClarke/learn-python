# iterables and loops
# problem with individually accessing items - try multiplying items
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
# how it can be done with a for loop
# for x in numbers:
#     print(x * 2)
# a string can be looped over because it is iterable
# for letter in 'Gary Clarke Tech':
#     print(letter)
# don't need to use the variable
# the range function
# for _ in range(100):
#     print(_ * 3)
# list function
new_list = list(range(100))
print(new_list[34])

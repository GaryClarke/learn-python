# tuples
my_list = ['one', 'two', 'three']
my_enumerated_list = list(enumerate(my_list))
# loop over enumerated list
# convert enumerate into a list
# access an item in enumerated list and check its type

# show syntax for creating a tuple

# show main difference i.e. can't reassign items
# immutability revision with string example

my_tuple = ('one', 2, ['three', 'four'], ['three', 'four'])
# show similarities (len(), mixed types, slicing and indexing
# show methods (count, index)
print(my_tuple.count(['three', 'four']))
# explain why use tuples - i.e. data integrity limits bugs - defensive programming
# use tuples as default unless you know list / list functionality is needed
